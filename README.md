### Face Recognition ### 
Face recognition is a method of identifying or verifying the identity of an individual using their face. Face recognition systems can be used to identify people in photos, video, or in real-time.

## Face Detection vs Face Recognition ##

**Face Detection** is identifying does the given picture has any face or not whereas **Face Recognition** is finding out whose face is there in the picture this is done by comparing the faces in the picture with the faces in database.

As we have seen the difference between the face recognition ad face detection this project works on *Face Recognition*.
